Setup
Create the Python virtual environment:
  :class: console

  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Important Note:
If you are using Python 3.8 instead of 3.7, then you will have issues with installing some of the packages in the requirements.txt file into your virtual environment.
For Python 3.8 students, we recommend deleting pyscopg2-binary from the requirements.txt file, and using pip install pyscopg2-binary in the terminal in order to successfully install this package.
Set up the database:
(venv) $createdb warbler
(venv) $python seed.py
Start the server:
(venv) $flask run

Below are the changes that I made to the starter code:
## **Part One: Fix Current Features**

### **Step One: Understand the Model**

Read ***models.py***. Make a diagram of the four tables.

Note that the ***follows*** table has an unusual arrangement: it has two foreign keys to the same table. Why?

Using pdb, set a debugger in one of your routes, and hit it to pause code execution. From here, try out the various relationships set on the model classes. Get a feel for how they work.

### **Step Two: Fix Logout**

Right now, there are links in the site to logout, but the logout route is not implemented.

On logout, it should flash a success message and redirect to the login page.

### **Step Three: Fix User Profile**

The profile page for users works, but is missing a few things:

- the location
- the bio
- the header image (which should be a background at the top)

Add these.

### **Step Four: Fix User Cards**

On the followers, following, and list-users pages, the user cards need to show the bio for the users. Add this.

### **Step Five: Profile Edit**

There are buttons throughout the site for editing your profile, but this is unimplemented.

- It should ensure a user is logged on (you can see how this is done in other routes)
- It should show a form with the following:
    - username
    - email
    - image_url
    - header_image_url
    - bio
    - password *[see below]*
- It should check that that password is the valid password for the user—if not, it should flash an error and return to the homepage.
- It should edit the user for all of these fields *except* password (ie, this is not an area where users can change their passwords–the password is only for checking if it is the current correct password.
- On success, it should redirect to the user detail page.

### **Step Six: Fix Homepage**

The homepage for logged-in-users should show the last 100 warbles **only from the users that the logged-in user is following, and that user**, rather than warbles from *all* users.

### **Step Seven: Research and Understand Login Strategy**

Look over the code in ***app.py*** related to authentication.

- How is the logged in user being kept track of?
- What is Flask’s ***g*** object?
- What is the purpose of ***add_user_to_g ?***
- What does ***@app.before_request*** mean?

## **Part Two: Add Likes**

**Do This Without AJAX/JavaScript**

Eventually, this would be a fine feature to integrate with JS/AJAX — that’s even a further study possibility!

For now, though: please build this as a pure backend feature in Flask. Liking a warble should NOT be done via AJAX right now.

Add a new feature that allows a user to “like” a warble. They should only be able to like warbles written by other users. They should put a star (or some other similar symbol) next to liked warbles.

They should be able to unlike a warble, by clicking on that star.

On a profile page, it should show how many warblers that user has liked, and this should link to a page showing their liked warbles.

## **Part Three: Add Tests**

Add tests. You’ll need to proceed carefully here, since testing things like logging in and logging out will need to be tested using the session object.

Let’s briefly discuss a couple of things related to tests: *how* you should test, and *what* you should test. We created some (mostly empty) test files:

- ***test_user_model.py***
- ***test_user_views.py***
- ***test_message_model.py***
- ***test_message_views.py***

In this case, there are four test files: two for testing the models, and two for testing the routes/view-functions.

We’ve put some boilerplate code into two of these to help you get started.

To run a file containing unittests, you can run the command `FLASK_ENV=production python -m unittest<name-of-python-file>`.

(We set ***FLASK_ENV*** for this command, so it doesn’t use debug mode, and therefore won’t use the Debug Toolbar during our tests).

If you are having an error running tests (comment out the line in your app.py that uses the Debug Toolbar)

So that’s *how* you should test. But *what*, exactly, should you be testing? Let’s take the above file structure as an example.

For model tests, you can simply verify that models have the attributes you expect, and write tests for any model methods.

**Here are some questions your tests should answer for the User model:**

1. Does the repr method work as expected?
2. Does ***is_following*** successfully detect when ***user1*** is following ***user2***?
3. Does ***is_following*** successfully detect when ***user1*** is not following ***user2***?
4. Does ***is_followed_by*** successfully detect when ***user1*** is followed by ***user2***?
5. Does ***is_followed_by*** successfully detect when ***user1*** is not followed by ***user2***?
6. Does ***User.create*** successfully create a new user given valid credentials?
7. Does ***User.create*** fail to create a new user if any of the validations (e.g. uniqueness, non-nullable fields) fail?
8. Does ***User.authenticate*** successfully return a user when given a valid username and password?
9. Does ***User.authenticate*** fail to return a user when the username is invalid?
10. Does ***User.authenticate*** fail to return a user when the password is invalid?

Try to formulate a similar set of questions for the **Message** model.

For the routing and view function tests, things get a bit more complicated. You should make sure that requests to all the endpoints supported in the ***views*** files return valid responses. Start by testing that the response code is what you expect, then do some light HTML testing to make sure the response is what you expect.

**You should also be testing authentication and authorization. Here are some examples of questions your view function tests should answer regarding these ideas:**

1. When you’re logged in, can you see the follower / following pages for any user?
2. When you’re logged out, are you disallowed from visiting a user’s follower / following pages?
3. When you’re logged in, can you add a message as yourself?
4. When you’re logged in, can you delete a message as yourself?
5. When you’re logged out, are you prohibited from adding messages?
6. When you’re logged out, are you prohibited from deleting messages?
7. When you’re logged in, are you prohibiting from adding a message as another user?
8. When you’re logged in, are you prohibiting from deleting a message as another user?

(This isn’t necessarily an exhaustive list of the tests you should write, but it should be enough to get you started.)

These tests are a bit trickier to write because they require you to make requests in the test, and look through the response in order to verify that the HTML you get back from the server looks correct.
